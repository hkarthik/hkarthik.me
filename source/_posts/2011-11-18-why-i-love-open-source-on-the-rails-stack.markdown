I've been consumer of open source for a long time. First via software
that I used (like Mozilla's Firefox) and later though consuming open
source code and contributing back to it. I've used open source on a
number of platforms over the years including Java, .NET, and Ruby on Rails.

Out of these three platforms, I think Rails has the most mature open
source ecosystem and this post will be my attempt and describing a developer's
open source work flow when using Ruby on Rails.

## Discovery
The first step to consuming open source to use on a Rails project is
discover existing open source libraries, or gems, as they're called
in Ruby to solve a problem you encounter while building your
application. 

In the Rails world, there are number of screencast sites, podcasts, and
blog posts out there that highlight useful gems and how to use them. 

Most gems are hosted via RubyGems.org. And they maintain a search index
with some limited information and links for more info on any gems
discovered there.

GitHub is also a good place to discover gems via search. Some key
criteria that I look for in a gem that I'm considering for in a production
application are the following:

- Recent commits within the last 3 months
- A high number of Forks/Watchers
- A low number of open Pull Requests.

These are just my personal guidelines, so if you're feeling more
adventurous, feel free to do so.

## Installing with Bundler

## Adjusting your versions

## Forking and bundling your fork

## Contributing back
