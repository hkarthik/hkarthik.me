{% img /images/family.jpg 500 333 my family %}

I am software developer living in Dallas, Texas with my wonderful wife Swati and my two beautiful daughters, Suhani and Sanika.

I grew up primarily in Colorado, and I attended the University of Colorado at Boulder where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I've always been a tinkerer, taking apart anything with a motor when I was younger, building PCs when I was in high school, and then taking up programming when I started attending college. Most of the development I did in college utilized C, C++, Lisp, and Java on the Unix platform.

Iâ€™ve spent a number of years doing .NET development in Enterprises, but two years ago I switched to working primarily with startups doing Ruby. Currently, I work for [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com) working on their [Desk.com](http://desk.com) customer support product.

I like to hack on Open Source projects whenever I get the chance. and I enjoy going to developer conferences and meetups. 

I'm a purveyor of all things startup related, and I primarily
prefer to work in or with software startups.

In my spare time, I'm an avid PC and Xbox gamer, and when I get the chance to hit the slopes, I enjoy both skiing and snowboarding.
