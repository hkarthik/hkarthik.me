{% img /images/family.jpg 500 333 my family %}

I am software developer living in Dallas, TX with my wonderful wife Swati and my
two beautiful daughters, Suhani and Sanika.

I grew up primarily in Colorado, and I attended the University of Colorado at
Boulder where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science in 2002.

I've always been a tinkerer, taking apart anything with a motor when I
was younger, building PCs when I was in high school, and then taking up
programming when I started attending college. Most of the development I
did in college utilized C, C++, Lisp, and Java on the Unix platform.

After a few brief stints in Quality Assurance and Project Management consulting, I returned to my roots as developer in 2005. I spent more than 6 years as a professional developer focusing exclusively on web development using ASP.NET.

In 2009, I began tinkering with Ruby on Rails as an alternative web
framework for personal projects. In 2011, this led to my becoming a
full time Ruby developer working in my current role with the rockstar
team at <a

I like to hack on Open Source projects whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy
going to development conferences, meetups and local technology focused
user groups. I'm a purveyor of all things startup related, and I primarily
prefer to work in or with software startups.

In my spare time, I'm an avid PC and Xbox gamer, and when I get the
chance to hit the slopes, I enjoy both skiing and snowboarding.
